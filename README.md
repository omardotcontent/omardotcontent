## 🌟 About Me  
I’m **Omar Mohamed**, born on **May 12, 2006** — a creator driven by design, storytelling, and clean digital experiences.

For over **6 years**, I’ve been working as a **Video Editor**, building cinematic visuals and motion-driven projects in **Adobe Premiere Pro**. Alongside video, I craft modern layouts, interfaces, and brand visuals across **Figma**, **PowerPoint**, and **Paint.NET**.

I’m also a **Developer** who enjoys building practical tools, clean user interfaces, and creative digital experiences. I work with:

- 🧩 **Java** (JavaFX apps, Minecraft plugins)  
- 🐍 **Python**  
- ⚙️ **C++**  
- 🌐 **HTML & CSS**

I’m constantly learning, iterating, and improving — whether it's visual, interactive, or technical work.
